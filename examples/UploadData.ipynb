    "\n",
    "The Upstream API allows you to:\n",
    "- Authenticate and obtain access tokens\n",
    "- Upload sensor definitions and measurement data\n",
    "- Manage environmental monitoring campaigns\n",
    "- Query and retrieve measurement data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Valid Upstream account credentials\n",
    "- Python 3.7+ with `requests` library installed\n",
    "- CSV files with sensor and measurement data formatted correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",

    "- Ensure coordinates are in decimal degrees format\n",
    "- Use WGS84 coordinate system (standard GPS coordinates)\n",
    "- Verify coordinates are accurate for your monitoring location\n",
    "- Test coordinates in mapping software before creating stations\n",
    "\n",
    "🏷️ **Station Naming:**\n",
    "- Use descriptive names that indicate location or purpose\n",
    "- Include geographic references or landmarks\n",
    "- Examples: \"River Bridge Station\", \"Industrial District Monitor\"\n",
    "\n",
    "📝 **Station Descriptions:**\n",
    "- Describe the physical location and surroundings\n",
    "- Note any special characteristics or constraints\n",

    "\n",
    "If you prefer using the web interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Navigate to Campaign:**\n",
    "   - Go to your created campaign in the web portal\n",
    "   - Access the campaign details page\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create Station:**\n",
    "   - Go to the \"Stations\" section within the campaign\n",
    "   - Click \"Add Station\"\n",
    "   - Provide station details and coordinates\n",
    "   - Save to get your Station ID\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Note the Station ID:**\n",
    "   - Copy the Station ID for use in data uploads\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Pro Tip:** Save your campaign and station IDs in a configuration file or notebook cell for easy reuse across multiple data uploads."

    "### CSV File Format Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sensors CSV Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Your `sensors.csv` file defines the sensor metadata and should follow this structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "alias,variablename,units,postprocess,postprocessscript\n",
    "temp_sensor_01,Air Temperature,°C,,\n",
    "humidity_01,Relative Humidity,%,,\n",
    "pressure_01,Atmospheric Pressure,hPa,,\n",
    "wind_speed_01,Wind Speed,m/s,true,wind_correction_script\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Column Descriptions:**\n",
    "- `alias`: Unique identifier for the sensor (used as column header in measurements)\n",
    "- `variablename`: Human-readable description of what the sensor measures\n",
    "- `units`: Measurement units (e.g., °C, %, hPa, m/s)\n",
    "- `postprocess`: Boolean flag indicating if post-processing is required\n",
    "- `postprocessscript`: Name of the post-processing script (if applicable)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Measurements CSV Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Your `measurements.csv` file contains the actual sensor data and should follow this structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "collectiontime,Lat_deg,Lon_deg,temp_sensor_01,humidity_01,pressure_01,wind_speed_01\n",
    "2024-01-15T10:30:00,30.2672,-97.7431,23.5,65.2,1013.25,2.3\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required Columns:**\n",
    "- `collectiontime`: Timestamp in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS)\n",
    "- `Lat_deg`: Latitude in decimal degrees\n",
    "- `Lon_deg`: Longitude in decimal degrees\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sensor Data Columns:**\n",
    "- Each sensor `alias` from sensors.csv becomes a column header\n",
    "- Column names must exactly match the sensor aliases\n",
    "- Empty values are automatically handled (see row 4 in example)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important File Format Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Critical Requirements:**\n",
    "- Each sensor `alias` from sensors.csv becomes a column in measurements.csv\n",
    "- `collectiontime`, `Lat_deg`, and `Lon_deg` are required columns in measurements.csv\n",
    "- Empty values are handled automatically by the system\n",
    "- Maximum file size is **500 MB per file**\n",
    "- Use UTF-8 encoding for both files\n",
    "- Timestamps should be in UTC or include timezone information\n",
    "\n",
    "📝 **Best Practices:**\n",
    "- Keep sensor aliases short but descriptive\n",
    "- Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., `sensor_type_number`)\n",
    "- Ensure measurement values match the units specified in sensors.csv\n",
    "- Include all sensors in measurements.csv even if some readings are missing\n",

    "## 7. Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **File Preparation:**\n",
    "   - Validate your CSV files before upload\n",
    "   - Ensure sensor aliases match between files\n",
    "   - Use consistent timestamp formats\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Error Handling:**\n",
    "   - Always wrap API calls in try-catch blocks\n",
    "   - Check file existence before upload\n",
    "   - Validate response status codes\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Security:**\n",
    "   - Never hardcode credentials in notebooks\n",
    "   - Store tokens securely\n",
    "   - Use environment variables for sensitive data\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Performance:**\n",
    "   - Keep files under 500 MB for optimal performance\n",
    "   - Use batch uploads for large datasets\n",
    "   - Monitor upload progress and statistics"
